I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/ron-pomper">Department of Communicative Sciences & Disorders</a> at Michigan State University. I direct the Language Learning Lab.

I study how children learn language, including children with typical language development, Developmental Language Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder. I use behavioral responses and eye-tracking methods to measure different aspects of children's ability to learn new words. My recent work investigates how children form detailed representations of the sounds that form words.

I completed my postdoctoral fellowship with Karla McGregor in the <a href="https://www.boystownhospital.org/research/speech-language/word-learning">Word Learning Lab</a> at Boys Town National Research Hospital and my PhD with Jenny Saffran in the <a href="https://infantlearning.waisman.wisc.edu/" target="\_blank">Infant Learning Lab</a> at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

I created a Shiny application to look up phonological information (frequency, age of acquisition, neighbors, clustering coefficient) for real words and made-up words. You can access it <a href="https://rpomper.github.io/phono/">here</a>. Note: it will take 1 to 2 minutes for the website to load, because it uses <a href="https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/">shinylive</a> to run the Shiny application locally rather than hosting it on an external server. I am in the process of writing up a manuscript describing the Shiny application and how to use it. Please let me know if you are using it, especially if you yave any feedback!
