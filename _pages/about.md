I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow working with Karla McGregor in the <a href="https://www.boystownhospital.org/research/speech-language/word-learning">Word Learning Lab</a> at Boys Town National Research Hospital. I completed my PhD in Developmental Psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison working with Jenny Saffran in the <a href="https://infantlearning.waisman.wisc.edu/" target="\_blank">Infant Learning Lab</a>.

I study how children learn language, including children with typical language development, Developmental Language Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder. I use behavioral responses and eye-tracking methods to measure different aspects of children's ability to learn new words. My recent work investigates how children form detailed representations of the sounds that form words.
